# Portfolio-User-Registry

A complete PHP-based messageboard application featuring full CRUD functionality for users, profiles, posts, and comments.

A simple PHP CRUD application that allows a user to create a new profile and sign in to post on a message board. 
- The message board can be viewed whether a profile is signed in or not.
- To post or comment on the message board you must create a profile and sign in.
- Posts can only be deleted by the profile that created the post.

There is also a secondary type of profile specifically for admins. Their profile is much the same however they are given the admin role. 
- By default there is one admin profile in the SQL database.
- Admins can view a complete list of profiles and have the capability to update and delete profile data.
- Admins can grant the role of 'admin' to any profile by modifying the profiles role from 'user' to 'admin'.
